# Homework-10-Web-Scraping-and-Mongo

Completed the assignment and made the basic html template (index.html which can be found in the templates folder). However, I then tried to use a Bootstrap theme to make a prettier template. It can be found as index_alternative.html in the templates folder.

Screenshots 1, 2, and 3 are from index.html, but Screenshots a through g are from the "prettier" index_alternative.html. I couldn't figure out how to change the free Bootstrap theme enough to get the Mars Data table centered in the container.
